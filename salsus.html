            <p>
                <strong>Salsus.</strong> No, that’s not a typo for “salsa.” It’s a premium stock and broth brand from Norway. Until recently, their market was pretty simple: Norway and Denmark. But then came the big idea — France. The land of sauces, brasseries, Michelin stars, and also… chefs who don’t exactly like being told how to cook.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, Salsus knocked on our doors at HEC with one clear ask:<br>
                <em>“Help us build our go-to-market strategy for France.”</em>
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/salsus.png" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">

            <p>
                Now, you’d think this is easy — after all, the French do love their sauces. But here’s where it gets tricky:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Not French.</strong> They were bringing in a Nordic brand into a market that takes pride in its culinary traditions. Imagine showing up to an Italian nonna’s kitchen with store-bought tomato sauce — yeah, exactly.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium pricing.</strong> Salsus wasn’t here to play in the discount aisle with Maggi cubes. They wanted premium positioning.</li>
                <li><strong>A proud ritual.</strong> French chefs like the morning routine of selecting vegetables, meat, bones, simmering it all day… it’s part of their craft, their pride. Telling them, “Hey, here’s a ready-made broth” is basically saying, “Hey, you know that centuries-old ritual? Skip it.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So yeah, no small challenge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step One: Back to Business School Basics</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a business student, so naturally the first instinct was… frameworks. (Sorry, can’t help it.)
            </p>
            <p>
                We started with the <strong>3C framework</strong>: Company, Competitors, Customers.
            </p>
            <h5>Company: Who is Salsus?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Premium stock and broth, made in Norway.</li>
                <li>Everything is fresh and organic — glacier water, pasture-raised animals, organic vegetables. (Basically, the cleanest broth you’ll ever taste.)</li>
                <li>In Norway, Michelin-star chefs were already using it. So the brand had pedigree — just not in France.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Competitors: Who else is in the pot?</h5>
            <p>
                We mapped the market on two axes: price and quality/healthiness.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/matrixsalsus.png" alt="Competitor mapping - placeholder image">
            <!-- <ul>
                <li><strong>High price, high health:</strong> Chef, Ariake Japan, L’Artisan Saucier.</li>
                <li><strong>Low price, still fairly okay:</strong> Soreal.</li>
                <li><strong>Low price, widely available:</strong> Maggi, Knorr, Comexo, Fuchs.</li>
            </ul> -->
            <p>
                Salsus clearly belonged in the premium high-price, high-quality quadrant. The good news: there was space there. The bad news: French chefs already had their trusted brands.
            </p>
            <h5>Customers: Who should we really be talking to?</h5>
            <p>
                This is where things got interesting. In Norway, Salsus targeted Michelin-star chefs and high-end restaurants. But in France, that wasn’t going to fly. Why? Because those chefs are married to their rituals, and no brand — no matter how premium — was going to convince them otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, we needed to pivot:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Large-volume premium players</strong> → catering services, big brasseries (Bouillons), and premium hotel restaurants. Here, efficiency matters because they’re cooking for hundreds.</li>
                <li><strong>French culinary schools</strong> → Le Cordon Bleu, Ferrandi Paris, Ecole Ducasse. Why? Because if young chefs start experimenting with Salsus early, they’ll carry that into their careers.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase directors/managers</strong> → In B2B, often they make the final call, not the chefs. So targeting them was just as important as wooing the culinary stars.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In short, Salsus needed to position itself as an enabler, not a replacer. Not: “We’ll take away your craft.” But rather: “We’ll save you time so you can focus on creativity.”
            </p>
            <p>And one final analysis from the b-school diaries — the infamous <strong>SWOT analysis</strong>
                <img src="assets/img/SWOT.png" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">

            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step Two: Defining the Brand</h2>
            <p>
                Before jumping into marketing, we had to nail the brand values and equity.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enable chefs to save time on broth-making so they can focus on creativity.</li>
                <li><strong>Promise:</strong> Healthy, sustainable, and consistent quality in every batch.</li>
                <li><strong>USP:</strong> The only Nordic culinary brand offering glacier-pure, chef-crafted broths.</li>
                <li><strong>Brand assets: </strong>Natural ingredients, sustainability, and premium quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Target Relationship:</strong> Build long-term trust with premium chefs and decision-makers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now we were ready to activate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step Three: Brand Activation</h2>
            <p>
                This is where the real fun started. There are three phases to it: Consideration, Buy, Retain (Yes, that's a marketing framework. Can't help it).
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 1: Consideration — Getting on the Radar</h4>
            <p>We asked: What makes a French chef curious?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Events:</strong> FInstead of cold calls (which would’ve been ignored faster than you can say non merci), we leaned into exclusivity. Imagine intimate chef-only events where they could taste, test, and — most importantly — gossip about Salsus. Because in France, if chefs are talking about you, you’ve already won half the battle.
                    We also suggested trade fairs like Sirha Lyon. Perfect stage for Salsus. Here, we showcase the brand among chefs, buyers, and culinary directors.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Partnerships:</strong> Here’s where inspiration struck: <em>Valrhona chocolates</em>, a premium chocolate brand used by the French chefs for desserts. <br>
                    So we pitched: “What if chefs ordering Valrhona got a free Salsus pack?”<br>
                    It’s simple sampling but framed in a premium way — target the right chefs without blasting it to the masses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social Media:</strong> No stock images of broth bowls. Instead, reels that celebrated the raw materials: glacier water cascading, organic carrots fresh from Nordic soil. Basically, sell the origin story, not just the product.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Advertisements:</strong> 
                    This was the “MBA-meets-Mad Men” moment. We proposed ads built on values, not just visuals: purity, sustainability, and consistency in every batch. My original draft ad leaned heavily on storytelling — glacier water, organic farms, Nordic purity. And funny enough, when Salsus later launched their French campaign… let’s just say their version looked very familiar.
                    <div style="margin-top:1rem;">
                        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHtSDKFLmrY?si=M4OTCKaCNsCB0JfB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Phase 2: Buy — Sealing the Deal</h4>
            <p>Here’s the thing: French chefs might like your idea, but that doesn’t mean they’ll actually order it. So how do you lower the barriers?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Website Redesign:</strong> Inspiration: Valrhona’s site. Their copy is beautifully chef-centered: “We believe chefs have the power to create a delicious and sustainable future, and we want to help you.”<br>
                    That’s a behavioral nudge — it appeals to emotion and purpose. We wanted Salsus’ website to do the same.
                   <br>
                    And enable small-quantity online orders for easy trials. For bulk orders, prompt chefs or purchase directors to call or email. Why? Because in high-ticket B2B, a human connection builds trust — and trust matters more than discounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pricing Mechanisms:</strong> Premium pricing stays — but bulk buyers get structured discounts. Enough to incentivize, not enough to erode brand positioning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Synergy Deals:</strong> Inspired from a personal experience at a coffee shop in Bruges. They boosted chocolate sales of their neighbour's by giving away luxury chocolates with every espresso. Why not do the same? Partner with distributors so chefs ordering Valrhona chocolate or other premium goods got a free trial of Salsus on the side. A foot in the kitchen door, quite literally.
                    
                <img src="assets/img/coffee.png" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Phase 3: Retain — Because First Orders Are Just the Beginning</h4>
            <p>We didn’t want Salsus to be a “one-and-done” curiosity. We wanted chefs to brag about it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Salsus Circle:</strong> A private, referral-only community where chefs could share recipes, swap hacks, and flaunt their membership. (Chefs love exclusivity almost as much as they love arguing about béchamel.)   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Salsus Savers:</strong> A loyalty program — cashback, discounts, maybe exclusive perks. Practical, but positioned for the premium audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Long-term dream:</strong> A Salsus Certification, developed with Michelin. This was the moonshot idea. Imagine a future where Salsus isn’t just a supplier but a Michelin-certified quality partner. It would take years, but if it worked, it would lock in credibility like nothing else. Ambitious? Yes. But hey, strategy is about vision too.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>So, What Happened?</h2>
            <p>
                We pitched this to the Country Head and Marketing Officer. Some of these strategies were actually implemented:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Salsus was <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salsus_salsus-sirha2025-gastronomie-activity-7308088955021783041-KfxR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACQGzYoBSw3EqGi9YIoA-m056poitBMNXlg" style="color:#003366; font-weight:500;text-decoration: underline;">present at Sirha Lyon.</a></li>
                <li>They launched <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salsus_d%C3%A9couvrez-lunivers-de-salsus-des-mati%C3%A8res-activity-7343201406402625537-lWL5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACQGzYoBSw3EqGi9YIoA-m056poitBMNXlg" style="color:#003366; font-weight:500; text-decoration: underline;">an ad</a> strikingly similar to the one I drafted.</li>
                <li>Salsus Professsionel is on <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/salsus_pro/" style="color:#003366; font-weight:500; text-decoration: underline;">Instagram.</a></li>
                <li>They <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salsus_salsus-est-fier-d%C3%AAtre-partenaire-des-bocuse-activity-7303689148400336896-ccmY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACQGzYoBSw3EqGi9YIoA-m056poitBMNXlg" style="color:#003366; font-weight:500; text-decoration: underline;">partnered with Bocuse d'Or Winners</a>, which is a good start if they're really manifesting the Salsus certification.</li>
                <li>And there's more to come, so watch <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/company/salsus/posts/?feedView=all" style="color:#003366; font-weight:500; text-decoration: underline;">this space.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>What would I change if I did it again?</strong><br>
                Probably focus more on short-term wins (3-month, 6-month, 12-month roadmap) rather than loading both short- and long-term ideas into one deck. But hey, some of it stuck — and in consulting, that’s a win.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Final Takeaway</h2>
            <p>
                The French market isn’t easy to crack. You can’t just show up with a broth and say, “Voilà.” But with the right positioning, storytelling, and a little nudge psychology, let's say if Salsus makes it happen</p>
