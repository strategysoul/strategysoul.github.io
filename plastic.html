    <!-- Intro -->
    
    <section>
      <p>India has a plastic problem. In 2021, the average Indian used somewhere between <strong>750 and 2143 plastic bags a year</strong>. Compare that to France, where people use just <strong>77 bags per person</strong>. That’s not a gap, that’s a canyon. And if the OECD is right, India’s plastic use could <strong>quadruple by 2050</strong> — reaching around 160 million tons by 2060. Basically, enough plastic to wrap the planet like cling film.</p>

      <!-- <img src="placeholder-intro.jpg" alt="Plastic waste pile - placeholder image"> -->
      <img src="assets/img/stat_plastic.png" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">

      <p>So, in 2022, the Indian government introduced a nationwide ban on single-use plastic. With penalties of up to €1000 (yes, a thousand) and even possible jail time. Sounds strict enough to scare people straight, right? <br/>Well… not really.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why the Ban Failed -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why the Ban Failed</h2>
      <p>Because humans are talented at ignoring rules when they’re inconvenient. The ban stumbled on three fronts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No cheap alternatives.</strong> Plastic is dirt cheap; eco-friendly options weren’t.</li>
        <li><strong>No motivation.</strong> The “why should I care today?” problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement? Forget it.</strong> Policing a billion people’s grocery bags is… ambitious.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The result? Plastic smuggling. Yes, actual smuggling of plastic bags. Police officers were inspecting kirana shops like they were raiding a drug cartel — except the contraband was shopping bags that cost a few rupees. The seriousness of the effort was real; the absurdity of the situation was too.</p>
      
      <!-- <img src="placeholder-ban.jpg" alt="Police inspecting store - placeholder image"> -->
    </section>

    <!-- Bans & Human Nature -->
    <section>
      <h2>Bans and Human Nature</h2>
      <p>India isn’t alone. Humans have a long, messy history with bans:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prohibition (US, 1920s):</strong> Alcohol was banned. People drank more.</li>
        <li><strong>Delhi’s firecracker ban:</strong> Logic said “less pollution.” Reality said “worst AQI yet.”</li>
        <li><strong>Kenya’s plastic ban (2016):</strong> Same outcome — smuggling, continued usage.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The pattern is clear: bans make people creative, not compliant.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Psychology -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why We Break Bans?</h2>
      <p>We dug into behavioral science to explain this rebellion, and found three psychological culprits:</p>
      
      <img src="assets/img/psych.png" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">
      <p>In simpler terms</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Bias:</strong> The bag makes my life easier today. The environmental cost shows up decades later. Guess which one wins.</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Dissonance:</strong> “I know plastic is bad, but my one bag won’t matter. Anyway, the corporations should fix this, not me.”</li>
        <li><strong>Normative Social Influence:</strong> If everyone else at the shop is taking plastic bags, do you really want to be the lone warrior saying no?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Green Card Solution -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Big Idea: The Green Card</h2>
      <p>Instead of punishing people, what if we rewarded them? Introducing <strong>Green Card</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Say no to plastic, scan your Green Card.</li>
        <li>Earn points.</li>
        <li>Use points to boost your <strong>credit score</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="assets/img/greencard.png" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">

      <p>In a country where loans power almost everything — education, homes, cars — linking eco-friendly choices to creditworthiness could actually change behavior. Suddenly, skipping a plastic bag isn’t about “saving the planet someday,” it’s about “getting your home loan approved today.”</p>

      <p>And technically, it’s feasible. India’s UPI scan-and-pay system already tracks billions of micro-transactions. Adding a loyalty-style card on top? Not exactly rocket science.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Nudges -->
    <section>
      <h2>Other Nudges</h2>
      <p>We also suggested smaller, psychology-backed nudges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Posters at checkout:</strong> “Only 1% of shoppers ask for plastic. Be the 99%.”</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-in bags:</strong> No more free handouts; you have to ask (and pay).</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic returns:</strong> Bring bags back, earn discounts or points.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Reaction -->
    <section>
      <h2>Did It Happen?</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/2.jpg" alt="Green card illustration - placeholder image">

      <p>Not yet. But we pitched it to <strong>Eric Singler (Founder, BVA Nudge Consulting)</strong>, and he loved it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “While everyone is pitching an app to track behavior, it’s impressive to see the old school behavioral solution that makes you a better citizen.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Encouraging words. But the real challenge is convincing banks and the government to link credit scores to bag usage. Bureaucracy moves slower than glaciers — and unfortunately, plastic doesn’t.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Final Thought</h2>
      <p>India’s plastic consumption is skyrocketing. A ban alone won’t solve it — history and psychology say so. But if avoiding plastic helps you get that home loan or tip your credit score in the right direction? That might just work.</p>
      <p>Because honestly, nobody wants to live in a country topping the charts for <strong>160 million tons of plastic waste</strong>. </p>
